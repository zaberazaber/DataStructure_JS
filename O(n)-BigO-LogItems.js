// So now we're going to look at our first big O notation and I start with O of n not because it's the

// most efficient or least efficient, but because I think it's the one that's easiest to get your head

// around.

// So I'm going to explain this with a function.

// And I'm going to call this function log items and we're just going to console log out some items.


// So we're going to run a for loop and the for loop is going to run.

// In times and there we're going to console log out I from the for loop.

// And that's it, pretty simple code,

// So there is our function, we're calling it with the number 10.

// And let's run this.

// And you can see that we've console logged out zero through nine.

// So this is an O of n operation.

// So to put it another way, we pass the function, the number n and this ran in times, so we pass it

// a 10 and it ran 10 times at output 10.

// Thinks.

// That's what O of n is.

// So let's take a look at this on a graph.

// O of n is always going to be a straight line, it is proportional, the number of operations is going to be proportional to whatever n is.

// So on this graph, the x axis represents n.

// The y axis represents the number of operations.

// OK, so that is our first big O notation and will be adding to this graph with the other big O notation

// so we can compare one against another.

// But for now, that is O of n.
