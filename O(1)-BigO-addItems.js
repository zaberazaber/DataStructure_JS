function addItem(n) {
    return n + n ;
}


// So our next big notation is of one.

// So let's start out with some code here.

// We have a function called add items and all we're going to do is we're going to return in plus N there's

// only one operation here and that's the addition.

// So it doesn't matter if in his one or in is a million, the number of operations is going to be one

// and that is a one.

// Well, what if we add.

// Another edition.

// Well, now that's two operations, right o of two, and as you may have guessed, we're going to simplify

// this and make it O of one.

// So we've won a lot of times is referred to as constant time, so this situation here where we have two

// editions.

// It's two operations that is constant, no matter what it is, the number of operations does not change

// as in changes.

// So let's take a look at this on the graph.

// It's just a flat line across the bottom, it is the most efficient bigo, nothing is more efficient

// than zero of one.

// Remember, you will also hear this referred to as constant time.

// So if you hear that phrase, that is of one.
